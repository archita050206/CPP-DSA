// hash function: converts the input code into some int or val
//                 called hash code
// compression: converting the number into some value which can ebe stored in the
//                 finite range of the hash table that i created

//collision: when there is more than 1 value of key for the same index

// solution: 
// 1. open hashing(seperate chaining): use linked list, the head of the linked list is 
//     stored in the index
//
// 2. close hashing (probing): find the other element some other place in the hash table
